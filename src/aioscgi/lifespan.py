class Manager:
    """
    Implements the ASGI lifespan protocol.

    This class is meant for use by an I/O adapter. The intended workflow is as follows:
    1.  The adapter constructs a Manager class. It passes the application callable
        directly. The other awaitables and the mutex should be constructed as
        appropriate for the I/O library. The callables should typically signal
        awaitables that the adapter’s main task can await, again as appropriate for the
        I/O library.
    2.  The adapter spawns a task which runs the Manager’s run method.
    3.  The adapter waits until the started callable is invoked (typically by the
        started callable signalling something which the adapter’s main task is
        awaiting). If an error message was provided, that message should be reported and
        startup aborted.
    4.  The adapter starts listening and running connections.
    5.  The adapter determines it is time to shut down the server.
    6.  The adapter stops listening.
    7.  If appropriate, the adapter waits for ongoing connections to complete. Otherwise
        it may choose to cancel them.
    8.  The adapter causes the awaitable passed as shutting_down to become ready.
    9.  The adapter waits until the shutdown_complete callable is invoked. If an error
        message was provided, that message should be reported.
    10. The adapter waits until the task which called the run method completes.
